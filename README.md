# Freemius Single-Sign On üîê WordPress Plugin

Easily allow users logging into your WordPress store with their Freemius credentials. If a user logs in with their Freemius credentials and there was no matching user in WordPress, a new user with the same email address and password will be created in WordPress.

When [embedding the User Dashboard](https://freemius.com/help/documentation/users-account-management/users-dashboard/) using our [User Dashboard WordPress plugin](https://github.com/Freemius/freemius-users-dashboard), a logged-in user will be automatically logged into their Freemius User Dashboard without the need to manually log in.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin.
2. Open the main plugin's file `freemius-wordpress-sso.php`, scroll to the bottom, and replace `<STORE_ID>`, `<DEVELOPER_ID>`, and `<DEVELOPER_SECRET_KEY>` with your details. You can get your _developer ID_ and _secret key_ in the **My Profile** page, and your _store ID_ in the **My Store** page. Both pages are accessible from the top-right menu.
3. Upload and activate the plugin.
4. Done! Users will be able to login with their Freemius credentials.
